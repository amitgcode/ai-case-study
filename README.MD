            - It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to organize requests into structure data. 
            - It uses Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to interpret the structure data to understand the context of request. It uses Collective Learning model to understand/convert the company specific request into generic workflow request. 
        - Dynamic Flow handles erratic conversation. 
        - Action Bid decides the best action of course for the request. 
        - Enterprise Cache transform information available inside different resources and systems for departments like IT, HR, Finance etc into simple text to be rendered into chat.
